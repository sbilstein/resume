            <ul>
              <li>
                Developed graphical simulators in Java for various robotics experiments that enabled researchers to quickly experiment with algorithms and generate datasets for use in publications. I used some of my own simulations to publish a paper at the WAFR2012 conference.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed peripheral drivers in C for a new <a href="http://mrsl.rice.edu/projects/r-one">R-one</a> robot platform on Stellaris ARM to interface with motors, accelerometers, gyroscopes, infrared and radio systems. This required learning how to troubleshoot hardware as well as software using gdb, oscilloscopes and various tools. The platform is intended for use in both research and educational purposes. I contributed to a publication about the robot for the DARS2010 conference.
